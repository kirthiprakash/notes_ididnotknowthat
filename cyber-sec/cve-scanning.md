# Clair vulnerability Scan on a host

Clair vulnerability scanning is designed to scan for vulnerabilities on a container image. But when tried to scan a host virtual machine by providing the /var/lib/dpkg/status in a tar format, it might result in false positives because of residual config files of an older version of a package.

Vulnerability scanners matchs pacakge name\( the CPE\) with the list of vulnerable pacakge feeds and reports it. It doesn't check if its actually in use or not. 

This problem might not occur on a container, because, there is no package upgradation happening on a running VM. It is just build once and it stays like that. The container layers are immutable.
