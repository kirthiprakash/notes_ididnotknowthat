# editablecontent



All you have to do is set the [`contenteditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#attr-contenteditable) attribute on nearly any HTML element to make it editable.

Here's a simple example which creates a [`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) element whose contents the user can edit.

```text
<div contenteditable="true">
  This text can be edited by the user.
</div>
```
