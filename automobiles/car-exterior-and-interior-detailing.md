# Car exterior and interior detailing

The glossy look was great after the detailing which involved scaling and polishing.

The strains on the fabric seats were completely gone and were looking new.

The car was delivered just like a brand new car from showroom.&#x20;

Corsa car care quoted Rs. 5500 for exterior detailing, Rs.2000 for interior detailing but if done together it costs Rs.6500. The ceramic coating was Rs.12000. The other branded car detailers quotes Rs.10000 and above for just exterior and interior detailing. 3M, carzspa etc.

When I got the car for wheel alignment and balancing to a local shop, he too offered detailing services and he quoted Rs.3000 for both interior and exterior detailing! Half the price compared to a branded detailer. I feel the detailing is not rocket science and these small local shops can match the quality of the branded detailers. Next time, probably another 3 years, I will get the detailing done in a local shop.
