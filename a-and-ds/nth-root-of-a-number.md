# Nth root of a number

To find a the nth root, by approximation, we can determine where does the x^n fall between 1^5 to y^n.

$$
\sqrt[5](67) \text{ falls between } 2^{5} = 32 \text{ and } 3^5= 243
$$

So 5th root of  67 is between 2 and 3 and is more near to the 2 than 3.

If can take binary search approach to zero in the on the real root.
